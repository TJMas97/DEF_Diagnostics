# DEF Diagnostics
GitHub repository containing the scripts for the diagnostic setup of the DEF Dosing System

# Python scripts
In this repository are two Python scripts:
- A Python script used for the sensor verification, which shows a GUI with live sensor feedback;
- A Python script used for system manipulation, which generates CAN messages related to engine parameters corresponding to the J1939 standard.

# Arduino script
In this repository there is also the necessary Arduino code, which is needed in conjuction with the Python script for sensor verification

# Updates
If updates to code are made during continuing work at Axces, code variants will be listed seperately and eventually merged after final defence has taken place
